  - name: Hair patterning
    aka: [Highlights, Lowlights, Dip dye]
    summary: Using chemicals to lighten or darken the colour of sections of the hair differently to other sections
    explanation: In highlights and lowlights, [hair colouring] is performed on only sections of the hair. This is most often done by using strips of foil to seperate the hair into sections. Other methods include using a cap which only certain strands of hair have been pulled through, or carefully painting colour onto certain sections with a brush. 
    subtypes:
      - name: Highlights
        description: Particular sections of the hair are lightened
      - name: Lowlights
        description: Particular sections of the hair are darkened
      - name: Dip dye
        description: Only the ends of the hair are coloured 
      - name: Ombre
        description: Hair near the top of the head is left darker, while hair at the bottom is lighter  
    safety: The chemicals involved in hair colouring may cause an allergic reaction. It is very important to always perform a "patch test" first by using the chemicals on a small area 48 hours before applying it to the rest of your hair.
    cost: around £30-50 on top of normal hair cut price

    aka: [Dyeing, Bleaching, Colouring]
    summary: Using chemicals to darken or change the colour of hair
    effects:
      - effect: "Hair density"
        description: "Hair colouring can make body hair look denser (by dying hair to make it darker) or make body hair look less dense (by bleaching hair to make it lighter)"
      - effect: "Hair colour"
        description: "Hair colouring can change the colour of head or body hair."
    duration: Hours to years.
    explanation: Hair colour uses a lightening step called "developer" (usually hydrogen peroxide based), followed by one of a variety of dyes. Depending on the type of dye (in particular, the molecular weight), the dye penetrates the hair differing amounts. Dye that penetrates further will result in a longer lasting effect - from lasting a few washes to until the hair grows out.
    subtypes:
    - name: Professional hair colouring
      description: The hair is lightened by a professional in a hair salon
    - name: Home hair colouring
      description: Using a kit bought in a shop, the hair is coloured at home 
    safety: The chemicals involved in hair colouring may cause an allergic reaction. It is very important to always perform a "patch test" first by using the chemicals on a small area 48 hours before applying it to the rest of your hair. 
    cost: £1-10 for home colour, £30-50 for salon colour

    aka: ["Laser hair removal"]
    summary: Permanently reducing the amount of hair by burning the hair and follicle using a laser
    permanent: "This procedure irreversibly reduces the amount of hair and cannot be undone."
    description: "In this procedure, the skin is exposed to pulses of laser light. The laser is of a specific wavelength that heats up the hair, causing the hair and hair follicle to be heated and destroyed, stopping that hair from regrowing. It is unable to remove hairs that are not dark, such as ginger or blonde hairs. It works most effectively on pale skin, though some newer machines work much more effectively on dark coloured skin."
    cost: "The price of laser hair reduction varies depending on the size of the area to be treated. A common area is the face and neck, which would normally cost around £100-200. If you have a [formal diagnosis] of gender dysphoria, the NHS may provide funding for some laser hair removal or [electolysis]."
    alternatives:
      IPL hair removal: "Quicker but less effective."
      Electolysis: "Much slower but can remove light hairs, and may have a more permanent effect."

    warning: "Some anti-androgens can cause permanent liver damage. Prolonged anti-androgen treatment can cause infertility, erectile dysfunction and genital shrinkage. Taking anti-androgens without also taking another sex hormone (e.g. [oestrogen] or [testosterone]) can cause osteoporosis."
    description: "Several medications are available which either reduce the effects of testosterone (cyproterone) or reduce the body's production of testosterone (other anti-androgens). These medications can reduce body hair growth and thickness and reduce erections."
    safety: "Anti-androgen treatment should be supervised by a medical professional. If this is not possible, you should carry out regular blood tests to avoid dangerous health complications."
    cost: "Anti-androgen treatment is available to people with a [formal diagnosis] of gender dysphoria for free on the NHS."
  - name: Testosterone
    summary: "Hormone with many effects including muscle strengthening, hair growth, and lowering voice pitch"
    categories: [hair, hair gain, voice, medications, hormones]

    warning: If you have a uterus (womb), doctors recommend you have a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the womb) within 2-5 years of taking testosterone.
    effects:
